## ROJECT WORK IN SF2935: MUSIC CLASSIFICATION

n this project a training data set from Spotify that consists of 501 songs with some high level
features is provided. The aim is to build a model that predicts weather Pierre likes (labeled ’1’)
or dislikes (labeled ’0’) these songs. The model capacity of prediction will then be measured on an
unlabeled test data set that contains 75 songs with the same high level features as the training data
set.

The specific task is to make use of the classification methods discussed during the course. From
these methods three are chosen and fine tuned as well as possible. Finally, one model is chosen and
putted into production. As an additional part of the project our model will be sent into a friendly
competition within the course, where the prediction accuracy on the test set will be uploaded on a
leaderboard
